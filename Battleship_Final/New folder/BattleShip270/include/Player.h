     * This is an array of probability heaps. Each heap stores the coordinates of a region in the grid ordering them by probability. This way
     * we maintain that the time complexity of finding the highest probability coordinate in a k by k region is O(1).
     * 
     * The elements stored in the heaps will be key-value pairs:
     *      - key: probability
     *      - value: grid coordinate (i,j)
     * 
     * 
     * The array will be initialized with three slots:
     *      - index 0: null chance probability regions
     *      - index 1: low probability regions
     *      - index 2: avg probability regions
     *      - index 3: high probability regions
     * 
     * Throughout the game certain regions will lose or gain probability. When that happens, they will be moved between the three arrays and placed
     * in the corresponding one.
     * 
     * How we determine in which array a certain priority queue is placed:
     *      When the probabilities of some region are updated, the entire heap is reassembeled which takes O(k) where k is the size of the largest
     *      ship so O(1). According to the highest probability in the heap we can know whether the region falls in low, average, or high probability range.
     *      According to the range, we decide where to move it.
     * 
     * This method solves two main problems:
     *      - Bot predictability
     *      - Accessing the highest probability in O(1)
